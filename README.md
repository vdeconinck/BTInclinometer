## "Remote" inclinometer for 4x4 (or other vehicles).

# What is it ?
Compared to other apps available, this one does not rely on the device's internal sensor, but on an external module.

# How ?
The module must be securely fixed to the vehicle and the app can then reliably show the vehicle's tilt and roll angles.
This app can of course be installed on phones or tablets, but also on Android head units.
Currently, the app only support WitMotion's modules, and tests have been performed with a BWT901CL.

# Details
This app was derived from WitMotion's demo application.
